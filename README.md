# 1Anunnaki
"and God said, "...Let us make man in our image, in our likeness..." by the bible

Thousands of years before the Bible was written, the ancient Sumerians, the first civilization on Earth, gave detailed accounts of the Gods who came to earth and created mankind, "...in their own image...", they called them the "Anunnaki". After millenia of ruling the ancient peoples of Earth, these great Gods, the Anunnaki, vanished without a trace...

...or did they? 

"1 ANUNNAKI" - Is the debut epic sci-fi/adventure, and first in the "ANUNNAKI TRILOGY" of original motion pictures, by visionary Writer/Producer/ Director/Composer and Digital & Visual FX Artist Jon Gress.

For almost a decade, Hollywood has predicted that some day in the near future, some talented filmmaker would put all of the pieces, the latest innovations in filmmaking, production, computer animation, digital & visual effects, electronic music and the latest advances in computer software technology, together to their highest and best use to create a movie that rivals those of Hollywood itself... and... all from the confines of his or her own studio.

That challenge has gone unmet... until now. Described as a fearless filmmaker, Jon Gress ' groundbreaking "1 ANUNNAKI" combines a spellbinding tale, an amazingly talented cast and crew, bold photography (whether air, sea, land or underwater), a perfectly crafted score and mindblowing digital & visual effects to create an "edge-of-your-seat" movie experience.

"The bar for independent feature film productions is about to be raised to a whole new level!..."

# About the Story

Dr. Jonah Ptah is an evolutionary geneticist. His life is turned upside down when his archaeological expedition, to excavate the remains of what is believed to have been the legendary Ark of Noah, is destroyed by a deadly missile attack immediately following the discovery of a small mysterious vial.

 Upon his return home to the United States, and to a teaching position at the University, he is suddenly the target of an high-level plot to have him assassinated... but why? Perhaps it has something to do with the horrifying visions he has of the end of mankind...
